= Adyen

Package to simplify including the Adyen payments services into a Ruby on Rails application.

Visit the wiki for documentation: https://github.com/wvanbergen/adyen/wiki.

Adyen integration relies on three modes of communication between Adyen, your server and
your client/customer:

* Client-to-Adyen communication using forms and redirects.
* Adyen-to-server communications using notifications.
* Server-to-Adyen communication using SOAP services.

This library aims to ease the implementation of all these modes into your application.
Moreover, it provides matchers, assertions and mocks to make it easier to implement an
automated test suite to assert the integration is working correctly.

== Usage

See the project wiki on https://github.com/wvanbergen/adyen/wiki to get started. Complete
RDoc documentation for the project can be found on http://rdoc.info/projects/wvanbergen/adyen.
